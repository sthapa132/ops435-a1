Algorithm for Assignment 1 First try

(1)Take the first data item YYYY/MM/DD (e.g. 2019/01/20),
    remove the two '/' and convert it to an integer

(2) Take the second data item N and convert it to an integer
    (it could be a positive or negative number)

(3) Add the 2nd integer to the 1st integer and assign the
    result to another integer object named "result"

(4) Convert the "result" integer object to a string object
    and insert two '/'s, one between 'YYYY' and 'MM', the
    other between 'MM' and 'DD', and send it to the standard
    output.
(5) Same as computing the date for the next day for a given
    date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. Write a detail algorithm
    for computing the date before a given date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.
